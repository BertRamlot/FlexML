# FlexML

A framework for building machine learning applications that is built on-top of PyQt. You should use FlexML, because it ...

- ... is highly modular.
- ... makes it extremely easy to go from data-gathering, to training, to testing, to production.
- ... actively supports and encourages doing data-gathering, training, and inference, all at once, in realtime.
- ... makes integrating a GUI easy, for any purpose (data-gathering, training, inference, ...).
- ... it uses only native PyQt6 classes as it base classes, making integration with existing PyQt6 projects easy.

To see FlexML in action, take a look at the fully fledged [eye tracker](./examples/eye_tracker/) that was built alongside this framework.
