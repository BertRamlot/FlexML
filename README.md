# FlexML

A framework for building machine learning applications that is built on-top of PyQt. You should use FlexML, because it ...

- ... is highly modular.
- ... makes it extremely easy to go from data-gathering to training to production. Even allowing you to gather data and train your model at runtime.
- ... makes integrating a GUI with the data-gathering/training/production easy.
- ... it uses only native PyQt6 classes as it base classes, making integration with existing PyQt6 projects easy.

FlexML is therefore ideal as a playground for a given ML problem, to see FlexML in action take a look at the [eye tracker](./examples/eye_tracker/) example.
